# [Reel Code Test]()

This is the repo for the Reel front end code test.

[Deployed live here]()

## Introduction 
For this test, I will be using the design of Reel itself as the inspiration. I think that would be more appropriate than creating a completely new design.



## Technology
The live demo is made with the following tech-stack and methodologies.

- Mobile First
- React/Redux
- CSS3, SASS/SCSS
- [BEM naming convention](https://en.bem.info/methodology/)
- Based on [SASS 7-1 Pattern](https://gist.github.com/rveitch/84cea9650092119527bc)

I will be using React with Redux for this test. I will be writing the styling using SASS with the SCSS syntax. The class naming convention will be based on the Block-element-modifier methodology. The folder structure for the SASS files will be based on the SASS 7-1 pattern and include what is necessary.

## Development Process

1. Getting Started 7/15/19
- If I understand the prompt correctly, I will be using a seed JSON file to feed in data would usually come from a backend.
- I will base the design of the page on the "Want list" section from Reel. Other than the required tasks of the test, some of the UI components may not be functional.
- First thing I am going to do is grab the main colors and fonts using the Chrome Dev Tools from Reel
- Gotham is not available. I will be using Montserrat as it is the closest free font.
- I am going to replicate the header,navbar, and footer first.

2. Building the Progress UI 7/18/19
- Looked to [Dribbble.com]("https://dribbble.com/shots/6451667-SneakersCrush-App-Redesign") and found a design to use as inspiration.
- Using a [HeroPattern SVG](https://www.heropatterns.com/) for the progress bar fill instead of plain color.
